# Marketing/comms team workflow

## TL; DR

The basic unit of work is a task. Tasks live in a team's _backlog_ and a project which might cross over teams. Each task is either part of a project or is a _service request_ – where a client asks for a discrete piece of work.

Each _project_ has a client who commissioned it, an end date (or can be marked as done when all tasks are completed), and is made up of tasks. There are several project templates which match the kind of project (e.g. an event). All projects fit under one of 5 _work priorities_.

All project tasks get planned in two-week _sprints_. At sprint planning, we review our planning tools: the editorial calendar, the backlogs, and project lists. We pull in tasks which we plan to get done within the 2-week sprint. 

### Outline:

* Portfolio
    - Project
* Team backlog
    - Task

## 5 Work Priorities:

All work we do should further these 5 priorities. These are priorities for the school – our team's overall success is the school's success.

### The five

* Increase enrolment: professional-programs, graduate, and undergraduate
* Support fund-raising and development
* Promote and demonstrate our research excellence through faculty
* Support our current student's experience while here

```
P1: Drive increased growth in Professional Programs
P2: Ensure all grad degree programs are filled
P3: Promote faculty and research excellence
P4: Assist the fundraising efforts of AAD
P5: Support events and 1-time programs with comms, marketing, web presence, registration
P6: Handle all the other stuff that gets thrown at us in ways that support programatic needs, strengthens our relationships with stakeholders, and preserves our reputation.
```
