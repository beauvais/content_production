### Identify Content Needs

#### Setup Google Drive

**Name your content, and create a folder for it on Google Drive.**

The very first step is to make sure there's a home for any content in Google Drive. Go into Google Drive and create a new folder. This is where all documents related to this content will live \(or be linked to, if they can't exist in Google Docs.\)

#### Share the Google Drive folder
**Share the folder with the right people. **

Choose your sharing options in Google Drive, and start listing the people you want to collaborate with by email address. If they don't show up automatically, make sure to put in the email address they use for Google Drive. 

*Optional: 'Get shareable link' in Google Drive, and share it with people via Slack.*

### Use Priority Framework

We look at content from three perspectives to help us make decisions about it.

* **Audience** – who is our content for? 
* **Purpose** – to what end is it published? 
* **Process** – how do we create, publish, and curate our content?

To put our content into these contexts, we ask a series of questions.

#### Applying priorities

If you decide as a team that this is not fit for purpose, do nothing further.

If you decide as a team that this content is worth doing in the near future, make sure it's shared with the right sprint teams to be included in their planning.

If you decide as a team that this _could_ work, but isn't for the near future, add it to an appropriate content backlog to review later.

2. Define purpose 2-1. Create a content plan Create a new doc in the Google Drive folder, name it "Content Plan," and copy text from the content plan template. Whether you collaborate on a content plan, or create it yourself, define the purpose, and create the doc in Google Drive. 2-1-1. Optional: hold a content-plan workshop Gather the right people together to quickly discuss what kind of content we can and should create. If you know about content you need to create in the near future \(such as the next sprint\), you can use a content-plan workshop to: Collaborate across teams \(and generate good ideas\) Define the scope of the content Identifying what kind of content is needed Planning where it'll live Making sure it's covered by campaigns and social-media channels Defining the team \(and what each person will do\) Setting a date for publishing and reviewing You can also collaborate on a content plan via Slack once you've created the content-plan doc in Google Drive \(see below\). 2-1-2. Define the purpose and audience We create content on purpose. So, we have to know why we plan to make it and who it's for. This lets us prioritise the content we create, and review content we manage so we know if it's fit for purpose. Answer: who's it for? Say who the most important audience is. Content created for everyone is suited to no one. You can have multiple audiences, but the more dispersed your audiences, the less your content tends to be relevant. We make sure to ask: "Why should I care?" from our audience's point of view. Good purpose definitions include their audience, and how we want to affect them. "This piece will demonstrate the current work of the Worker Institute so that people interested in professional courses will feel confident in ILR's reputation." "This piece will show potential undergraduates where to go who come to our site from an event email campaign."

2-1-3. Define success If the purpose statement is not sufficiently clear, make sure to include specific kinds of success to measure how effective this content will be. Examples include: Pageviews on a site Interactions on social media Feedback from stakeholders Clicks from an email campaign Actions taken on the web Form filled in Button clicked Page visited

2-1-4. Define the content team Define the team Owner \(someone who says: "I'll be the one to take this story and make it happen."\) Contributor Organiser Reviewer Approver Publisher Stakeholders \(people who are involved or responsible for a story\) Informed \(just need to be told that something's happening\) Engaged \(need to be part of the creation\) Deciders \(do they need sign-off\) Share the folder on Google Drive with the people listed in the team. 3. Content Requirements Define the kind of content you want to create. This can be a page on a site, a printed postcard, a poster... anything that shares ILR's story and is fit for purpose. 3-1. Content types Choose the right kinds of content to fit your purposes. You might need to create or commission several to accomplish your goals. Examples include: News story \(on the ILR website\) Featured on home? Email campaign Social Media post \(or series\) Twitter Instagram Facebook LinkedIn 4. Content Quality Image Aptness: "Does this image illustrate the story or does it emotionally engage with our intended audience?" Dimensions File name \(make sure it's descriptive like cookie\_day.jpg and not DSC02849.jpg\) File size Alt text \(for screen-readers\) Caption \(visible to readers\) Interviews Text Video
