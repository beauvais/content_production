# Content Plan Template

## Purpose

**Answer: what's it for?**

Define the purpose straight away. Don't start thinking about the media, the photos, the tone, or the website until you've jotted down the reason you're creating content. Set its context, and say what you want to accomplish by creating \(or reviewing\) it.

**e.g.**

* "We want ILRies to go to the Alice Cook lecture. If they can’t make it, they can watch it online."
* "We want current undergraduate students to feel connected to ILR and know they can get cookies."

## Audience

**Answer: who's it for?**

Say who the most important audience is. Content created for _everyone_ is suited to _no one_. You can have a couple, but the more dispersed your audiences, the less your content tends to be relevant.

**e.g.**

* The primary audience is recent alumni who work in HR.
* The primary audience is potential undergraduate students.
* The primary audience is current students who live on campus.

You can also include secondary audiences – people for whom this would be good for them to know, but you're not highly focused on them.

You can't have secondary audiences without a primary audience.

## Calls to action

**Answer: what do you want me to do with this? and: what's next?**

With a purpose and an audience defined, lay out what you want people to do with this content.

**If appropriate, list any calls to action.**

**e.g.**

* Register \(link to registration form\)
* Find our more \(link to blog post\)
* Get in touch \(mailto link, or link to contact form\)
* Join \(link to sign-up form\)

_Be sure to consider an onward journey._

**e.g.**

* Read this related story

## Creation plan

**Answer: How will we make and use it?**

Set down what will make up this content, where it will be published, and record any special requirements it raises. Include dates, both when commissioned and by when it needs publishing.

**e.g.**

This is a webpage with text and an image. It'll live at /programs/our\_new\_offering. It'll take two weeks to write, and a week to organise photos.

Commissioned: 20 September, 2019 Published: 15 October, 2019

## Governance

**Answer: Who will make it, and who will approve it?**

Include everyone who needs to be a part of the team. Record their names and what they'll do for this piece:

* Zach will write the text
* David will take photos
* Mary will approve it
* Aaron will build the call to action
