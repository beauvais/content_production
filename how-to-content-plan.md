# How to create a content plan

{% page-ref page="content_plan_template.md" %}

Create a new doc in the Google Drive folder, name it "Content Plan," and copy text from the content plan template.

Whether you collaborate on a content plan, or create it yourself, define the purpose, and create the doc in Google Drive.

## Optional: hold a content-plan workshop

Gather the right people together to quickly discuss what kind of content we can and should create. If you know about content you need to create in the near future \(such as the next sprint\), you can use a content-plan workshop to:

* **Collaborate across teams** \(and generate good ideas\)
* **Define the scope of the content**
  * Identifying what kind of content is needed
  * Planning where it'll live
  * Making sure it's covered by campaigns and social-media channels
  * Defining the team \(and what each person will do\)
  * Setting a date for publishing and reviewing 

You can also collaborate on a content plan via Slack once you've created the content-plan doc in Google Drive \(see below\).

## Define the purpose and audience

**We create content on purpose**. So, we have to know why we plan to make it and who it's for. This lets us prioritize the content we create, and review content we manage so we know if it's fit for purpose.

**Answer: who's it for?**
{% endhint %}

Say who the most important audience is. Content created for everyone is suited to no one. You can have multiple audiences, but the more dispersed your audiences, the less your content tends to be relevant.

We make sure to ask: **"Why should I care?"** from our audience's point of view.

{% hint style="info" %}
Good purpose definitions include their audience, and how we want to affect them.

_"This piece will demonstrate the current work of the Worker Institute so that people interested in professional courses will feel confident in ILR's reputation."_

_"This piece will show potential undergraduates where to go who come to our site from an event email campaign."_
{% endhint %}

## Define success

If the purpose statement is not sufficiently clear, make sure to include specific kinds of success to measure how effective this content will be. Examples include:

* Pageviews on a site
* Interactions on social media
* Feedback from stakeholders
* Clicks from an email campaign
* Actions taken on the web
  * Form filled in
  * Button clicked
  * Page visited

## Define the content team

Capture who will do what to create, approve, and publish your content.

* Owner \(someone who says: "I'll be the one to take this story and make it happen."\)
* Contributor
* Organiser
* Reviewer
* Approver
* Publisher
* Stakeholders \(people who are involved or responsible for a story\)
  * Informed \(just need to be told that something's happening\)
  * Engaged \(need to be part of the creation\)
  * Deciders \(do they need sign-off\)

Share the folder on Google Drive with the people listed in the team.
