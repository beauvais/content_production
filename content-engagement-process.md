# Content strategy engagement process

This is a perpetual draft of the process we are designing to help us support ILR's marketing and communications through content strategy. Here, we set out how we run marketing, website, and communications projects.

## Broad Outcomes

These are the intended results of applied content strategy.

* Updated web presence
    - Reviewed, purposeful content
    - New, consistent ILR branding
    - Reviewed IA (the map of your site)
* Recapitulated purpose
    - Defined content and communications purposes
    - Articulated audiences
    - Reviewed, embodied mission statements
    - Messaging to articulate your value
* Tools and ongoing mission support
    - Assets
        + Page templates
        + Powerpoint slides
        + Marketing collateral
    - Campaigns
    - Content planning and support

### Discover

Discovery is where we aim to set the scope of work to be done. We start wide with purpose definitions and broad needs assessments, narrowing down into identifying tasks to be done. We'd look to assess what we have (looking at existing content, marketing channels and initiatives, websites, etc). General discovery outcomes include:

* Defined purposes
* Articulated audiences
* Broad needs assessed
* A review of the context (e.g. what content are we currently using?)
* A scope of work
    - Marketing plan
    - Communication plan
    - Website story

The first two – purpose and audience – are the most important contexts that need definition during discovery.

The depth of discovery depends on the scope of work. For a quick marketing campaign that follows a pattern we've established, for example, we can discover what needs doing from a few conversations and a quick content plan. For something involving multiple teams and months instead of days, discovery should expand to cover the detail we need to know what needs doing, when, and by whom.

We use different discovery tools – all exist to help define purposes. They tend toward answering *why* and *what* questions. What do we want to do? Why? What will our users want to see? Why? 

Most projects don't use every tool. The most common activity is a workshop, where the people proposing and planning to do the work meet with us to set out what we want to get done, why, and make sure we've defined our audiences for any public-facing work.

The scope of work describes outcomes of any change, and put any work into perspective of priority, effort and time involved, and the teams who will be working on a project. Depending on the project, we'll use one of these kinds of scopes:

* Marketing plan – lead by Dave Yantorno
* Communications plan – lead by Mary Catt
* Website story – lead by David DeMello

#### Typical discovery tools include:

* Interviews
* Affinity mapping
* Workshops
* Persona development
* User research
* Heuristic analysis
* Content audit and audit framework development
* Scope outline

### Plan

Content planning is where we decide how to accomplish the goals we've discovered. This is where we map proposed changes and outcomes to prioritised tasks and teams. 

The outcome of planning is a set of working documents or outlining tools (e.g. project management apps) that are geared up for doing the work.

All three teams here use a form of Agile project methodology to get things done. So, at planning, we will want to fit different pieces of work into our overall workflows. It's important that we consider priorities. 

Breaking down planning into an outline would typically look like this:

* Finalise scope and changes
    - Define success for any change or initiative
    - Create a content plan
    - Finish filling in the right scope plan
* Outline resources
    - Content
        + Copy
        + Images
        + Video
        + Training
    - Marketing plan
        + Email
        + Social
        + Landing-page
        + Advertised
