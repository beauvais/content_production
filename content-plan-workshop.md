# Content-plan workshop

{% hint style="success" %}
**Host a short (20-minute) workshop to create a content plan.**
{% endhint %}

When planning content around upcoming events, getting a few people together for a short workshop has proven to be efficient for time, and good for generating ideas.

The objective of the workshop is essentially to collaboratively fill-in a [content plan](content_plan_template.md). You want to:

* **Define the content purpose**
    - Look for needs you and those you support have
    - Specifically ask what your users or audiences care about
* **Outline the kinds of content** you want to create
* **Decide who will create** and organise which content
* **Plan when content will be produced** and published
* **Share the content plan** with the wider team (in Google Docs)

*You can also collaborate on a content plan via Slack and Google Docs.*

## Example workshop: content for Labor Day

With the importance of Labor Day to the mission of ILR, we have it marked in our [calendars](editorial_calendar.md). 

* 4 people from 2 teams met a couple weeks before Labor Day for about 20 minutes
* We first identified the content purpose: *We want people interested in labor movements to associate ILR with Labor Day.*
* We reviewed existing content, and decided to emphasise a story we'd already started creating
* We planned when that story would go live and who would create, edit, and review it
* We outlined a series of content for social media that told the story of Labor day (past, present, and future)
* We planned who would create the social-media posts, and listed where we could find images for them
